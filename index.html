    <p>The History of Lake Cumberland

    DerwentwaterLake Cumberland State Resort Park outside of Jamestown, Kentucky is one of the region's most poplar recreational areas. A water enthusiasts paradise and a house boaters dream, Lake Cumberland has seen tremendous improvements of the past few decades that make it an ideal location for a thrilling vacation amid nature. However, the need for hydroelectric power and a reservoir for flood control fueled interest in creating the lake as opposed to establishing a recreational site.
    
    The impoundment of the Cumberland River in 1952 saw the creation of Wolf Creek Dam, the 25th largest of its kind in the US. Unfortunately, the dam has seen quite a few problems over the years including cracks, leaks, and breaches. Although the dam has prevented millions of dollars in flood damage since its creation, the costs are seemingly absorbed in the continual repairs required by the dam.
    
    The dam was constructed just one year after the Secretary of the Army set aside a few thousand acres of this land for the development of the park. Originally named Lure Lodge due to the amazing fishing the lake offered, the name was changed to Pumpkin Creek Lodge in 1962 after the new lodge facilities created there. By this era, rustic vacation cottages, campground facilities, and other amenities were in place to welcome the first official park visitors to Lake Cumberland that same year.
    
    Word of Lake Cumberland's activities and beautiful scenery had spread, and more visitors were coming to check out Kentucky's State Parks. Developers decided to add more cottages, tennis courts, a golf course, grocery stores, a playground, and other community services to draw in more visitors. Indoor recreations were even taken into consideration by the late 1980s with the addition of posh amenities to the lodge like Jacuzzis, game rooms, and a fitness center.
    
    Today, houseboating is one of the most popular recreational activities on Lake Cumberland, and it's common for more than 1500 houseboats to be on the lake during the high season. Whether people go to Lake Cumberland for a little rest and relaxation or for an exhilarating outdoor experience, the possibilities are endless.</p>

    Activities and Attractions at Lake Cumberland State Resort Park

    Houseboat rentals are very popular, and this option takes care of visitor's lodging and gives them a way to get around the lake to see the top sights; however, renting a kayak, jet ski, or small speed boat gives one even more freedom to move about. The Jamestown Marina & Resort is the place to head for all boating needs and wants on the lake.
    
    Just about any season is a great one to visit Lake Cumberland, but the winters can be chilly and snowy, so much of the lake action concludes in October. Many come here to relish in the summer sun, while others prefer heading here in the fall when the leaves make their iconic autumn transition.
    
    Birding enthusiasts enjoy the vast array of viewing and spotting opportunities around Lake Cumberland. The red-tailed hawk, the American Kestrel, and several owls species including the great horned barred, and screech owls frequent here. Fall and winter's chillier months bring out the wood ducks, whip-poor-wills, mallards, and the green and great blue herons.
    
    Hiking along the beautiful shoreline or up into the bluffs are popular visitor activities on land. Old Hickory and oak forests overlook the lake, and there are two moderate hiking trails that are recommended for travelers. Baugh Branch Trail is about a mile and a half linear trail with easy, level terrain. The reward for making the trek is fantastic vistas overlooking the Baugh's Branch. Lake Bluff Trail is about a four-mile hike that begins at the Park Activities Center. This one's a bit tougher with steeper slopes and rougher grades, but it's a worthwhile hiking trail at Lake Cumberland.
    
    Horseback riding is available around the lake from Memorial Day through Labor Day, and the golf course is open year round. Tee times may be scarce in the summer, so book early. Disc golf is a popular sport on Lake Cumberland, and the public course is open year round. Fishing, of course, is exciting on Lake Cumberland. Largemouth and smallmouth bass are highly sought after, but many come seeking the walleye and occasional sturgeon. Recent lake level reductions have the fishing rumored to be better than ever at Lake Cumberland
